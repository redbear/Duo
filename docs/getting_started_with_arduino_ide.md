# Duo: Getting Started with Arduino IDE
---

The Duo has the custom Particle firmware installed by default during manufacturing, which enables you to develop applications using the Arduino IDE. You can directly connect your Duo to your computer via its native USB port or mount your Duo onto an RBLink and connect the RBLink to computer via RBLink USB port.

## <span id="requirements">Requirements</span>

* Arduino IDE v1.6.7 or above
* RedBear Duo development board
* RBLink programmer (optional)
* Micro USB cable 


## <span id="essential-setup">Essential Setup</span>

1. Connect the Duo directly to your computer via its native USB port with micro USB cable. Alternatively, if you have an RBLink in hand, you can mount the Duo onto your RBLink and connect the RBLink to your computer via RBLink USB port with micro USB cable. It's fine if you connect the Duo directly to computer while it is mounted onto RBLink.

2. (**Windows Only**) Install USB driver. If you connect the Duo directly to your computer, then install the Duo application USB driver and the Duo DFU USB driver. If you connect the RBLink to computer, then install the RBLink USB driver. Please follow the [Windows Driver Installation Guide](windows_driver_installation_guide.md) to install those drivers if you haven't done it before.

3. Download and install the corresponding Arduino IDE 1.6.7 or above for your Operating System.

4. Start Arduino IDE. Please follow the [Arduino Board Package Installation Guide](arduino_board_package_installation_guide.md) to install the board package for Duo.

5. (**Linux Only**) Configure development environment

    - Update UDEV rules

        For Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04) users: Modem Manager will try to use the Duo as a modem, which will cause the upload process fail using Arduino IDE. To allow Arduino IDE to upload correctly, you need to fix it by modifying the UDEV rule -- write a simple UDEV rule to ignore it from being handled by modem manager.

	        $ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/77-mm-usb-device-blacklist.rules
	
        Simply add this single line:

	        ATTR{idVendor}=="2b04", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"


    - Install lsb-core

        On Linux, if you cannot compile sketches because of the gcc or g++ not being found by Arduino IDE:

	        $ sudo apt-get install lsb-core


## <span id="update-system-firmware">Update System Firmware</span>

You should check the [board package change-log](duo_arduino_board_package_changelog.md) to see if there is a new released version of the board package. If available, you can simply follow the [Arduino Board Package Installation Guide](arduino_board_package_installation_guide.md) to update the board package to the latest version. 

Since Duo board package v0.2.5, there is always a copy of the Duo's system firmware within the package. According to the board package change-log, it declares which version of the system firmware that should be compatible with applications developed based on the corresponding board package. If you've worked through the [Out-of-Box Experience](out_of_box_experience.md), you should have known the system firmware version of your Duo. If not, 

* Connect your Duo **directly** to computer.
* Navigate to "Tools > Port", select the port for the Duo.
* Open the "Serial Monitor" at the top-right corner of Arduino IDE.
* Send the lowercase '**v**', the Duo will echo its system firmware version:

If your Duo's current system version is not the same as the one declared in the board package you've installed, follow the section "**Using Arduino IDE**" of the [Firmware Deployment Guide](firmware_deployment_guide.md), to update the system firmware for your Duo. 


## <span id="first-simple-application">First Simple Application</span>
1. Navigate to "Tools > Board", select the "**RedBear Duo (Native USB Port)**" as the target board if you connect the Duo via its native USB port, or select "**RedBear Duo (RBLink USB Port)**" if you connect the RBLink with the  Duo mounted onto it.

2. Navigate to "Tools > Port", select the port for the Duo or RBLink.

3. Navigate to "File > Examples > RedBear_Duo > 01.Basic", select "**Duo\_Blink**" to open the example.

4. Click on the ![image](images/Upload_icon.png) icon to compile the sketch followed by automatically uploading this sketch to your Duo. After the upload completes, you will see the on-board blue LED toggles in one second intervals.

5. Well done! You could try more other examples that under "File > Examples > RedBear_Duo" or just start coding your own sketch to build an awesome project!
